# EnvironmentMapping
This is a project developed during Final Year Project as BSc of Games Design & Development.
The project uses Augmented Reality on Android devices in combination with Point Cloud to scan the user's physical space.
This Point Cloud data can be saved on mobile device and brought into the Virtual Reality.
In Virtual Reality, the Point Cloud data is recreated and sorted through using Octrees to create simple visual representation of the environment scanned.
