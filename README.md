# EnvironmentMapping
This is a project developed during Final Year Project as BSc of Games Design & Development.<br/>
The project uses Augmented Reality on Android devices in combination with Point Cloud to scan the user's physical space.<br/>
This Point Cloud data can be saved on mobile device and brought into the Virtual Reality.<br/>
In Virtual Reality, the Point Cloud data is recreated and sorted through using Octrees to create simple visual representation of the environment scanned.<br/>
